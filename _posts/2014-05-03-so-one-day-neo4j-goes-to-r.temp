Open source licenses are among the most effective tools the open communities use in order to guard the commons and ensure they remain freely and easily accessible by the individuals as intended. The open licenses often implement several provisions along three important dimensions: Regulating _modes of attribution_, defining _sharing conditions_ for original and derivative works, as well as mapping out the eventual _limitations applicable to commercial use_. While open license may vary in their provisions along each of these three dimensions, those relating to sharing conditions seem to be the most controversial ones given their far-reaching impacts. Sharing conditions are at the core of the debate between the proponents of what we call _viral_ licenses and those of _permissive_ licenses. 

## Openness as a right

A strong stance on the sharing conditions often comprises clauses that are designed to make sure that open code remains open and all the derivatives and mashups drawing on it are distributed under the original licensing regime. A good example of the strong stance is Free Software Foundation's (FSF) General Public License (GPL) that requires all the derivative works to be published under GPL. For FSF openness is a right to be defended. The objective of GPL is not only to keep what is open open, but rather to ensure that openness prevails by making it difficult for properietary software (or even hardware in GPL 3.0) to access open source tools. GPL is a continuous and active effort to keep the proprietary and the open software ecosystems separate, and to make sure the open one gains ground by pushing back the non-pure players. 

The promise is that as GPL'd commons expand their offering, proprietary software producers will increasingly face a choice between (1) relying on GPL'd code at the cost of opening up at least a part of their platform and (2) keeping their platform closed and paying the price of reinventing the wheel, which is developing a solution that already exists for free. FSF has regularly updated GPL to make sure new technological evolutions won't take the viral nature of GPL away. Among other improvements, GPL 3.0 was designed to close the loopholes that allowed the hardware companies to release products that embed unmodifiable versions of GPL-licensed code. GPL 3.0 also takes measures against the use of what it calls Digital Restriction Management on GPL'd code. Such restrictions and their usefulness in promoting open source have raised questions and controversies across the community, including the famous decision by Linus Torvalds not to ever upgrade Linux Kernel's license to GPL version 3.0.

## Openness as a norm

A weak stance on the sharing conditions emphasizes primarily the proper attribution and unrestricted use of code (i.e. freedom in use), over and above imposing licensing terms on derivative works. For instance the Apache license requires all derivative works relying on Apache-licensed code to carry the original license notice and a changelog that specifies the eventual modifications, but does not stipulate any licensing condition for the derivative work, neither it requires publication of the derivative works. Licenses that take a weak stance on the sharing conditions are commonly known as permissive licenses, referring to 

Openness as societal norm (come as you are)


One can characterize this as trying to 

a strong share-alike stance implies non-commercial. for instance gpl's requirement about gpl-licensing all derivative work makes it practically impossible to link the code with any non-gpl code, use it in hardware that does not provide direct access to the users or distribute it under DRM (thereforce restricting accessibility). A strong share-alike clause actually erodes the economic basis for offering commercial derivative products, even though it may not explicitly prohibit them. That is why creative commons does not recommend the adoption of non-commercial license restrictions, arguing that share-alike is sufficiently viral to keep IP free and freely accessible.

The pretext for the viral caluses is that it is essential to defend the freedom of the free software by closely controlling the intents of their use by controlling the way they are combined and distributed. Although this is an argument to be tested, the prevalence of GPL as the best known and most used open source license is the most convincing argument for the model it has been defending for long (see black duck software). IT makes sense to think that the viral natur of GPL, once adopted as a major license, will ensure its prevalence by creating network effects. In such a case, we must see a significance growth in the use of GPL over time...

Nonetheless, it also makes sesne to think that GPL's license, which can at times be as restrictive as a commercial licese, can be too restrictive for certain uses and to the extent that open source sowftare becomes prevalent, many commercial developers will probably prefer releasing their code under alternative, more permissive licenses. If this latter arugemtn is true, we should probably observe a decline in use of GPL.

Given the huge database I have on the ruby community i decided to test whether one or the other is true by creating a time-relevant analysis of the data. Although the share of software using GPL as its unique license is still fairly large, one may want to check whether new projects will actually drop into the virality trap spreade by GPL, or that they will adopt another less restrictive, more permissive licese. I mined the license information from the spec files, readme files and license files and came up with a timeline of license choice for ruby community. (see bekow)

Turns out the more "permissive licenses" are getting more and more popular as compared to GPL.

Virality is a double-edged sword: While it may induce some newcomers to adopt the license in order to benefit from the body of intellectual property readily available under that license, it may as well dissuade the others that find the viral clauses too restrictive for their use cases. Ultimately, it is not clear what is the effect of vitality on the attachment Behavior of newcomers. The best way to check that is to observe the attachment Behavior over time.
