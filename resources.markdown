title: resources and tools of the trade

Here is a list of resources and tools that I have become increasingly dependent upon in my research work. I keep this list up-to-date both for my personal use and for public interest.

## Basics

### Shells & Terminals

* [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) -- Very nice set of shell configurations with hoards of useful plugins
	* Use with [agnoster](https://gist.github.com/agnoster/3712874) theme for full effect
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) -- The ultimate terminal
* [TotalTerminal](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com) -- Quake-style HUD console of OSX
