# data carpentry workshop
## jan. 2016


## Terminal.com, research scientist's best friend

[Terminal.com](http://terminal.com) offers you a range of affordable and easily scalable virtual machines where you can install your required software without manipulating your personal computer. Most of the freely distributable software are already available on Terminal as duplicable images. Simply find your image, and launch it. You can adjust the specifications of your machine while working. The machine will pause automatically if you stop working with it.

Head over to [Terminal.com](http://terminal.com) and create a free account. You may need to spend a few bucks to charge your account so that you can keep your virtual machine running during the workshop.

## Scraping data from the web using KimonoLabs

[Ryan Rowe and Pratap Ranade](http://www.wired.com/2014/03/kimono/) have suffered their way through PhD programs in their earlier lives, so when they decided to design a data gathering interface, they knew exactly how it shouldn't be. [KimonoLabs](https://www.kimonolabs.com) has been up for less than two years now, and with its intuitive and smart interface it has brought web scraping to a new level. Open a free KimonoLabs account and download [the Kimono extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kimono/deoaddaobnieaecelinfdllcgdehimih) for Google Chrome as well. You will also need the [Kimono add-on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kimono/gincecdpheaeldbkjinnmloiiomnakee) for [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets). Open a Google Sheet and install the Kimono add-on from the add-ons menu.
